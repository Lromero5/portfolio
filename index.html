    <p> Hello! My name is Leticia. I was born and raised in Chicago, IL. Currently, I am an elementary school teacher looking to make the switch to web development. I have been very lucky to have worked many years doing something I love. 
        I look forward to what the future has for me. 
    </p>

    <p>This section will contain a second paragraph about me
