    <p class="inline"> Hello! My name is Leticia. I was born and raised in Chicago, IL. Currently, I am an elementary school teacher looking to make the switch to web development. I have been very lucky to have worked many years doing something I love. 
        I look forward to what the future has for me. 
    </p>

    <p> I am attending Northwestern University's Coding Bootcamp in Chicago. I hope to learn all that the bootcamp has to offer. When I am not working or in school I enjoy spending time with my family and friends, traveling, or organizing game nights.
